## Key Features Implementation

### VIP Access Control

```php
// In Event model
public function isVipAccessPeriod(): bool
{
    $now = now();
    return $this->special_start_date && $this->special_end_date &&
           $now->between($this->special_start_date, $this->special_end_date);
}

public function canUserBook($user): bool
{
    if (!$this->isVipAccessPeriod()) {
        return true; // Anyone can book outside VIP period
    }
    
    return $user && $user->isVip(); // Only VIP during VIP period
}
```

### Capacity Management

```php
// In Event model
public function getAvailableTicketsAttribute(): int
{
    $soldTickets = $this->tickets()->where('status', 'confirmed')->sum('quantity');
    return max(0, $this->capacity - $soldTickets);
}
```

### Ticket Cancellation

```php
// In TicketController
public function cancel(Ticket $ticket)
{
    // Validation: user owns ticket, event hasn't passed
    if ($ticket->event->hasPassed()) {
        return back()->withErrors(['error' => 'Cannot cancel tickets for past events.']);
    }
    
    $ticket->update(['status' => 'cancelled']);
    // Tickets automatically return to available pool
}
```
